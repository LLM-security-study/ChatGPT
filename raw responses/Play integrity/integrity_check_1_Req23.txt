Some parts of your request involve use of Google Play App Licensing API. This API will help in verifying the app status with Google Play Store.

A Google Play Licensing service can help you enforce licensing policies for applications that you publish on Google Play Store. With Google Play Licensing, your application can query Google Play at runtime to obtain the licensing status for the current user. 

Here's a typical outline of a Java Program which achieves your goal. Please note that this is a simplified example to give you an idea and an actual implementation would involve more complexities, including error checking, working with threads and others.

Main.java:
```Java
import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;

import com.google.android.vending.licensing.AESObfuscator;
import com.google.android.vending.licensing.LicenseChecker;
import com.google.android.vending.licensing.LicenseCheckerCallback;
import com.google.android.vending.licensing.ServerManagedPolicy;

public class Main extends Activity {

    private LicenseCheckerCallback mLicenseCheckerCallback;
    private LicenseChecker mChecker;

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // set your activity layout

        String deviceId = Secure.getString(getContentResolver(), Secure.ANDROID_ID);

        mLicenseCheckerCallback = new MyLicenseCheckerCallback();

        byte[] SALT = new byte[]{1, 42, -12, -1, 54, 98, -100, -12, 43, 2, -6, 73, 6, 64, -11, -32, -8, 9, 5, -36};
        mChecker = new LicenseChecker(getApplicationContext(), 
                new ServerManagedPolicy(this, new AESObfuscator(SALT, getPackageName(), deviceId)), 
                "YOUR BASE64 PUBLIC KEY");  

        mChecker.checkAccess(mLicenseCheckerCallback);
    }

    private class MyLicenseCheckerCallback implements LicenseCheckerCallback {

        public void allow(int reason) {
            if (isFinishing()) return;
            // Should allow user access.
        }

        public void dontAllow(int reason) {
            if (isFinishing()) return;
            // Should not allow access. In most cases, the app should assume
            // the user has access unless it encounters this. If it does,
            // the app should inform the user of their unlicensed ways
            // and then either shut down the app or limit the user to a
            // restricted set of features.
            // In this example, we show a dialog that takes the user to Market.
        }

        public void applicationError(int errorCode) {

        }
    }
}
```

In this code, "YOUR BASE64 PUBLIC KEY" is your public key obtained from the Google Play Developer Console.

Remember, this is just a basic example of how you could implement license checking with Google's provided APIs. Security is a complex field, and you'd likely want to add additional hardening and fallbacks to this solution to make it more robust.
