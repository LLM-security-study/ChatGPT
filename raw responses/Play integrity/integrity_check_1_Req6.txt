Google Play does not provide any specific API for checking whether the application is interacting with its unmodified binary that Google Play recognizes. 

However, for checking the integrity of an application binary you can use Google's SafetyNet Attestation API. SafetyNet provides a set of services and APIs that can protect your app against security threats, including device tampering, bad URLs, potentially harmful apps, and fake users.

The SafetyNet Attestation API is an anti-abuse API that allows app developers to assess the Android device their app is running on. The API should be used as a part of your abuse detection system to help determine whether your servers are interacting with your genuine app running on a genuine Android device.

A simple usage of the SafetyNet Attestation API to check an app's integrity can look like this:

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     
        String nonceData = "Random-Data-Can-Be-Anything"; //It's a random data to be associated with the request

        byte[] nonce = nonceData.getBytes();

        SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest(nonce, "<Your-API-Key>")
                .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onSuccess(SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response) {
                        // Use the response. You may want to send it to your server for further process.
                        String jwsResult = response.getJwsResult();

                        // This string contains a cryptographic signature that you can use to verify the
                        // authenticity of the payload. The signature is located at the end of the string,
                        // following the second period (.) character and you use it to confirm that 
                        // the data was sent by Google Play services.
                        // You decode it like this:
                        //  Signature = JWS-SignatureURL-Safe decode(split(JWS-Result, ".")[2]) 
                        //
                        // Now, if it doesn't pass the verification, potentially this is not a genuine app.
                        }
                });
    }
}
```

Note: SafetyNet Attestation API is not designed to determine whether the binary is unmodified in the way that Google Play recognizes it. It just helps to ensure that the app is running on a real and not a tampered device. The API helps you assess the security and compatibility of the Android environment in which your app is running.
