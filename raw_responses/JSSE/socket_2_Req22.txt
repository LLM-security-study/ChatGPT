Sure, I will demonstrate just a snippet to show a basic SSL connection in Java using the `javax.net.ssl` package. Below is a basic example of how you might handle an SSL connection in Java.

Remember before running this script you have to provide the correct host and port of the server you want to connect to, this is a simple example to show how to establish SSL connection: 

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "YourHost";
        int port = 443; // replace with your port 
        try {
            
            SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket(host, port);
            
            PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream());
            BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));
            
            // Send some data
            output.println("Hello World");
            output.flush();
            
            // Receive data
            String response = input.readLine();
            System.out.println("Received: " + response);
            
            // Close connections
            output.close();
            input.close();
            sslSocket.close();
            
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This is a very basic example and may require more error and exception handling based on your specific requirements. Also, remember you need to get the certificate from the remote SSL server and import it into your local JVM keystore if the certificate isn't issued by a trusted authority (self-signed certificate).

The program creates an `SSLSocketFactory` and uses it to create an `SSLSocket`. It then opens input and output streams on the socket and communicates with a SSL server.

Please replace the `host` and `port` variables with your remote SSL server's host and port.
