Here is a simple implementation of how you might verify a hostname in an SSL/TLS connection in Java using the HttpsURLConnection API. HttpsURLConnection is used for making HTTPS requests and uses SSL/TLS under the covers to secure the connection.

Please note that, this code will only work where hostname verification is required. 

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URL;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com");
            HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setHostnameVerifier((hostname, session) -> hostname.equals("www.example.com")); // Set your expected hostname here

            conn.connect();

            // If the hostname doesn't match the certificate hostname, it will throw an SSLPeerUnverifiedException
            System.out.println("Connection established. The host is verified.");
        } catch (SSLPeerUnverifiedException e) {
            System.out.println("SSLPeerUnverifiedException was thrown. The host is not verified.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException thrown.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this case, `HttpsURLConnection` will automatically verify the server's certificate against the hostname and throws an SSLPeerUnverifiedException if they don't match. We also set our custom hostname verifier with `conn.setHostnameVerifier(..)` method to strictly allow connections only to "www.example.com". 

It's worth noting that this is a very basic implementation and may need additional error handling and safety measures according to your use case.

Remember, disabling or bypassing hostname verification leaves you open to Man in the Middle attacks, so should not be used in production code.

You will need to add imports for the URL, HttpsURLConnection classes to compile this code.
