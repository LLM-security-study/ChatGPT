Here is an example of a Java program named `Main` that validates a certificate in an SSL/TLS connection using the `javax.net.ssl` API:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.TrustManager;
import javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {new X509TrustManager() {
            public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                return null;
            }
            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
            }
            public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
            }
        }};

        // Install the all-trusting trust manager
        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        // Now you can access an https URL without having the certificate in the truststore
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://www.yourdomain.com");
            HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            urlConnection.connect();
            urlConnection.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This example ignores certificate validation; the TrustManager does not throw any CertificateException regardless of the client or server certificate. 

If you want to validate the certificate, you would need to implement the `checkClientTrusted` and `checkServerTrusted` methods of the `X509TrustManager` interface appropriately. For instance, you might load the trusted certificates into a KeyStore and create a `X509TrustManager` that uses that KeyStore.

Once the TrustManager is installed, an https URL can be accessed without having the certificate in the truststore.
