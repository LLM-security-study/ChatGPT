The main library we are going to use to verify the integrity of an Android app is Google's SafetyNet API. 

SafetyNet provides a set of services and APIs that help protect your app against security threats, including device tampering, bad URLs, potentially harmful apps, and fake users.

The safetyNet attestation API is used to determine whether or not the device running your app might be a Potentially Harmful Device(PHD).

Below is a sample Java program which verifies the integrity of an Android app.

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.Task;
import android.util.Log;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String nonceData = "Safety Net Sample: " + System.currentTimeMillis();
        byte[] nonce = nonceData.getBytes();

        Task<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse> attestTask = SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest(nonce, API_KEY);

        attestTask.addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response) {
                // Indicates communication with the service was successful.
                // Use response.getJwsResult() to get the result data.
                Log.d("My App", "SafetyNet result: "+ response.getJwsResult());
            }

            public void onFailure(Exception e) {
                // An error occurred while communicating with the service.
                Log.d("My App", "Error occurred "+ e.getMessage());
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This program will attest(default method of SafetyNet API) the current environment of the device and returns a JSON Web Signature (JWS) response which can be used to verify the integrity of the app. Please replace "API_KEY" with your actual API key. 

Please note, this code is to be run in a mobile device(Android Environment) and not on a PC with Java main class.
