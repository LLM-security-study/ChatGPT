Sure, please note that this task can't be fully completed as in real case because it needs actual SSL certificate file and its password. Here is a general Java code to get it done.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.cert.Certificate;
import java.security.cert.CertificateFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a file input stream to read the certificate file.
            FileInputStream certInputStream = new FileInputStream("path_to_cert_file");

            // Create a certificate factory and use it to load the certificate file
            CertificateFactory certFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
            Certificate cert = certFactory.generateCertificate(certInputStream);

            // Create a keystore instance and load it
            KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
            
            // The password you need to open the keystore, In reality, it should not be hardcoded. 
            char[] keyStorePassword = "password".toCharArray();
            keyStore.load(null, keyStorePassword); 

            // Store the certificate into the keystore
            keyStore.setCertificateEntry("alias", cert); 

            // Write the keystore into a file
            FileOutputStream keyStoreOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("keystore.jks"); 
            keyStore.store(keyStoreOutputStream, keyStorePassword);

            // Closing the streams
            certInputStream.close();
            keyStoreOutputStream.close();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Please replace "path_to_cert_file" with the path to your .cer file and replace "password" with the password of your keystore which you want to create.

Make sure that you treat passwords and other sensitive data properly. Also, you should always properly handle exceptions, the above is just a barebones example.
