For verifying the integrity of an Android app, we can make use of the SafetyNet API from Google Play Services. This API is used to check whether a device is compromised or not and whether the app is running in a safe environment.

Here is a basic Java example of how to do it:

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       String apiKey = "your_google_api_key";
       checkAppIntegrity(api_key);
    }

    public static void checkAppIntegrity(String apiKey) {
        Task<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse> task = SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest(nonce.getBytes(), apiKey);

        task.addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse> () {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response) {
                // Indicates communication with the service was successful.
                // Use response.getJwsResult() to get the result data.
                System.out.println("Success! SafetyNet result:\n" + result.getJwsResult() + "\n");
            }
        });

        task.addOnFailureListener(this, new OnFailureListener() {
            @Override
            public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) {
               // An error occurred while communicating with the service.
               System.out.println("Failure! An error occurred while communicating with the service, " + e);
            }
        });

    }
}
```

Note: Remember to replace "your_google_api_key" with your actual Google API key. Also, the `nonce` in `attest(nonce.getBytes(), apiKey)` should be replaced with a bit of data that is used once and is tied to the specific request you are making.

This is a very basic implementation of the SafetyNet API functionality for checking app integrity. You should also handle exceptions and verify the SafetyNet API response in a secure server.
