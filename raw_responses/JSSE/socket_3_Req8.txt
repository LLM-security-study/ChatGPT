To create an SSL Socket in Java, you can use the standard Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) API. Here's an example of how this might look in a simple program.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket("YourHostName", 443); 

            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream()));
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));

            //You can use 'out' to send requests to the server and 'in' to get the response from the server over the SSL Socket
            
            // Close streams
            out.close();
            in.close();

        } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.err.println("Failed to create SSL Socket: " + ex);
        }
    }
}
```

This program creates an SSL Socket to communicate with a remote server. SSLSocketFactory is used to create SSLSockets. We're using it to create a socket connected to "YourHostName" on port 443, typically used for secure web traffic.

Please replace `YourHostName` with your actual host name or IP address to connect.

Ensure that:
- You're connecting to a server that supports SSL on the port you're using.
- You handle the necessary SSL handshake and authentication processes. These generally occur automatically, but might need extra code if the server has special requirements (like client certificates).
- You are handling all necessary input/output streams and their respective exceptions. 

Please check SSL certificate before establishing communication for secure and reliable conversation.
