Sure, here's a simple Java program that establishes SSL Sockets to enable secure communication with a server. This will use the javax.net.ssl package that comes with the JDK.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket("ServerIp", ServerPort); // replace "ServerIp" and ServerPort with your server info

        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream())));
        out.println("Hello Server"); // Sends "Hello Server" to the server
        out.flush();

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream())); // retrieving data from the server
        System.out.println("Server response: " + in.readLine());

        out.close();
        in.close();
        sslSocket.close();
    }
}
```

* This basic Java program creates an SSLSocket instance that connects your client to a specified server on a specified port.
* Data sent through this socket is automatically encrypted.
* I have included code to write a simple message ("Hello Server") to the server and read the response from the server.

Before the above program can work, however, you need to set up SSL on the server and client side which is a bit more involving, and beyond the scope of this question.

Few important points: 
- Replace the "ServerIp" and ServerPort with your server's IP and Port information.
- You need to load and provide necessary SSL certificates for the client and server to establish a handshake.
- This is just a basic example without any error handling and proper closing of resources for simplicity.
- Practical usage of SSL communication is quite an extensive topic involving a significant amount of setup and consideration, not fully covered by this basic example.
