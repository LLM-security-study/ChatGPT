Here is a simple example of how to create a Java program that uses SSL Sockets for secure communication. This program will connect to a server on a specified port and send a request message.

The main APIs used here are from the javax.net.ssl package of the Java standard libraries.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "your_server.com";
        int port = 1234;
        try {
            // create SSL socket and connect it to the remote server
            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory)SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket)sslSocketFactory.createSocket(host, port);
            
            // create input and output streams
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream()));
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));
            
            // send request to the server
            out.println("Your request here...");
            out.flush();
            
            // read response from the server
            String line;
            while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Received: " + line);
            }

            // clean up
            in.close();
            out.close();
            sslSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException ioexception) {
            ioexception.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Replace "your_server.com" and 1234 with the address and the port of your server. Also, replace "Your request here..." with the actual request message you want to send.

This is a simple implementation that doesn't involve any kind of authentication or certificate management. In a production environment, you would probably need to use keystore and truststore files to establish a trusted SSL connection with the server. This goes beyond the scope of this simple example.

Disclaimer: As with any networking code, you should not run this against servers you do not own or have permission to test against.
