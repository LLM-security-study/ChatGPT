The purpose is to verify the validity of a certificate in SSL connection using HttpsURLConnection. Here's a simple illustration of how you can achieve it in Java: 

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.Certificate;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Main().inspectCertificate("https://www.google.com");  
  }

  public void inspectCertificate(String urlString){
      try {
          URL url = new URL(urlString);
          HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
          conn.connect();
          Certificate[] certificates = conn.getServerCertificates();
          
          for(Certificate certificate : certificates) {
              System.out.println("Certificate is: " + certificate);
              if(certificate instanceof X509Certificate) {
                  try {
                      ((X509Certificate)certificate).checkValidity();
                      System.out.println("Certificate is valid.");
                  } catch(Exception e) {
                      System.err.println("Certificate is not valid.");
                  }
              }
          }
      } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
      } catch (IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
      }
  }

}
```
In the code above, we interact with the page "https://www.google.com" and try to extract the certificate from this SSL connection using the `getServerCertificates()` function. We then check if the obtained certificate is an instance of `X509Certificate` and use `checkValidity()` function to ensure the validity of the certificates.

Please replace "https://www.google.com" with the URL you want to inspect. 

Do bear in mind to include all the suitable exception handling for production ready code.

This program does not depend on external libraries other than Java itself. It uses the HttpsURLConnection API from javax.net.ssl package which is part of Java Standard Edition.
