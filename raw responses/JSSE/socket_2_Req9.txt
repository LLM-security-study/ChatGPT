Alright. In this case, I am going to use Java's Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), included in the standard Java platform.

JSSE provides a framework and an implementation for a Java version of the SSL and TLS protocols. 

Here is the skeleton code:

```java
import java.io.*;
import javax.net.ssl.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String serverName = "example.com"; // Insert your server name here
    int port = 1234; // Insert your port number here

    System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "myTrustStore.jts");
    
    try {
      SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
      SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket(serverName, port);

      InputStream inputstream = sslsocket.getInputStream();
      InputStreamReader inputstreamreader = new InputStreamReader(inputstream);
      BufferedReader bufferedreader = new BufferedReader(inputstreamreader);

      String rawInput = null;
      while ((rawInput = bufferedreader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(rawInput);
      }
    } catch (Exception exception) {
      exception.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
This program first picks up the settings for SSL from the system properties set with the `System.setProperty()` method. Then it gets the default `SSLSocketFactory`, and uses it to create an `SSLSocket` to connect to the specified server and port.

After connecting, it opens the input stream, buffering it so that it's possible to read lines from it. This can further be used for processing before printing to the console.

**Note**:
1. Replace `"myTrustStore.jts"` with the path to your truststore file. You should include the actual serverName and port number.
2. Full path might be needed for the .jts file depending upon where it's stored.
3. This program does not close its network connections. You should modify it to properly close connections when you're done with them.
4. Error handling is kept to a minimum for the clarity of the program, robust code would have more complex error handling.

Keep in mind SSL connections should be used in combination with correct endpoint identity verification, correct certificate validation, and possibly appropriate encryption to ensure the security of the data.
