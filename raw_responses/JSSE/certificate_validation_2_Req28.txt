Here's how you might write that in Java:

```Java

import java.net.URL;
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        try {
            // specify the url and create connection
            URL url = new URL("https://www.google.com");
            HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
            
            // get the certificate from the server
            conn.connect();
            java.security.cert.Certificate[] certs = conn.getServerCertificates();
            
            System.out.println("Server certificate :");
            for(int i = 0; i < certs.length; i++){
                java.security.cert.Certificate cert=certs[i];
                System.out.println("Certificate is : " + cert.toString());
            }
            
            // disconnect the url connection after use
            conn.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we are creating a connection using the HttpsURLConnection API which is a part of the Java standard libraries used to create secure SSL/TLS connections. 

We attempt to open a connection to the specified URL and call the getServerCertificates() function to retrieve the server certificates. The certificates are then printed out line by line.

If there is an error (for example, the certificate could not be retrieved), the exception is printed out.
