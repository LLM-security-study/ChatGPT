Sure, you can use Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) which is a standard Java API for SSL communication.

Here's a basic example of how you can set up an SSL Socket. This is a basic example and might not be applicable in all scenarios. You need to modify it as per your needs.

Note: you need to import following packages
```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.io.*;
```

Implementation:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket("localhost", 443);

            PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));
            output.println("GET / HTTP/1.1");
            output.println();
            output.flush();

            BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

            String line;
            while ((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }

            input.close();
            output.close();
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This example assumes that there is an SSL-enabled server listening on port 443 of localhost.

This creation of an SSL socket and communication to a server includes several steps:

1. Use the getDefault() static method of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory class to obtain an instance of SSLSocketFactory.

2. Use the createSocket() method of SSLSocketFactory to create an SSLSocket. This method takes a hostname and port number as input.

3. After the SSL socket is set up, communication proceeds like communication over any other socket. You can get InputStream and OutputStream instances to communicate with the server.

4. When finished communicating, close the socket.

This is a very simple example and does not include several important things such as handling exceptions, authenticating the server, client-side authentication etc. But it does give a start on how to set up an SSL connection.

Also note that in a real-world application, you should not print received data directly to the console because it might contain sensitive information.

Please refer to JSSE Reference Guide for more detailed information.
