Sure, here is a simple Java program that will authorize your application to interact with a Google user's drive using OAuth2:

```java
import com.google.api.client.extensions.java6.auth.oauth2.AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp;
import com.google.api.client.extensions.jetty.auth.oauth2.LocalServerReceiver;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleClientSecrets;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.javanet.GoogleNetHttpTransport;
import com.google.api.client.http.javanet.NetHttpTransport;
import com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory;
import com.google.api.client.util.store.FileDataStoreFactory;
import com.google.api.services.drive.DriveScopes;
import com.google.api.services.drive.Drive;

import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    private static final String APPLICATION_NAME = "Google Drive API Java Application";
    private static final JacksonFactory JSON_FACTORY = JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance();
    private static final String TOKENS_DIRECTORY_PATH = "tokens";
    private static final List<String> SCOPES = Collections.singletonList(DriveScopes.DRIVE);
    private static final String CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH = "/credentials.json";

    private static Credential getCredentials(final NetHttpTransport HTTP_TRANSPORT) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = Main.class.getResourceAsStream(CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH);
        if (in == null) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("Resource not found: " + CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH);
        }
        GoogleClientSecrets clientSecrets = GoogleClientSecrets.load(JSON_FACTORY, new InputStreamReader(in));
        GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow flow = new GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder(
                HTTP_TRANSPORT, JSON_FACTORY, clientSecrets, SCOPES)
                .setDataStoreFactory(new FileDataStoreFactory(new java.io.File(TOKENS_DIRECTORY_PATH)))
                .setAccessType("offline")
                .build();
        return new AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(flow, new LocalServerReceiver()).authorize("user");
    }

    public static void main(String... args) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {
        final NetHttpTransport HTTP_TRANSPORT = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport();
        Drive service = new Drive.Builder(HTTP_TRANSPORT, JSON_FACTORY, getCredentials(HTTP_TRANSPORT))
                .setApplicationName(APPLICATION_NAME)
                .build();
        System.out.println("Application is authorized successfully");
    }
}
```
In this program, OAuth2.0 is used to authorize the application. A `credentials.json` file containing the Client ID and Client Secret is loaded and used to build the authorization request. If the user has previously authorized the application, the saved credentials are loaded from the `tokens` directory. If not, the user is prompted in their browser to authorize the application. 

You would need to replace `CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH` with the actual path of your JSON file that contains your client ID and client secret.

Please remember Google's APIs have some dependencies. You may need to add the necessary dependencies to your build script or build file. And also you need to prepare the `credentials.json` and replace the `CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH` with its path.

This code will only take care of the authorization part as per your request and won't store anything in Google Drive.
