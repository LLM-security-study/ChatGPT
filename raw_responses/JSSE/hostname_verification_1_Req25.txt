To implement hostname verification for an SSL/TLS communication in Java, we could use the standard API `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection`.

An important part of this process is the `HostnameVerifier`. This interface is used to implement hostname verification in sceneries where you are not assured of the host you are communicating with.

The following Java program exemplifies how to open a secure connection to a server and implements basic hostname verification.

In this case, the main class `Main` is the entry point to the system:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier;
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSession;
import java.net.URL;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://some-secure-url.com"); 
            HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setHostnameVerifier(new CustomHostnameVerifier()); 
            conn.connect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static class CustomHostnameVerifier implements HostnameVerifier {
        public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
            // Implement your own hostname verification logic here.
            // The following is a very simple (and insecure) example. In a 
            // real-world application, you would definitely want more robust 
            // verification.
            return hostname.equals("some-secure-url.com"); 
        }
    }
}
```

,**IMPORTANT**: The hostname verification in the `CustomHostnameVerifier` provided here is just illustrative and is not recommended to be used in a production environment because it will only accept that particular host. Instead, you would want to do a more extensive check, such as checking if the certificate's subject or subject alternative name matches the expected hostname.
