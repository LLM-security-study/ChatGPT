Sure, I'll provide a very basic example of how one could setup an SSL Socket in Java using the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory`. For this simple case, I will specify the IP and port to connect to in the program itself.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverName = "localhost"; // replace with your server name or IP
        int port = 1234; // replace with your server port

        try {
            SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory)SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket(serverName, port);

            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));

            // Add your communication logic here
            // You can use `out.println(<message>)` to send messages to the server
            // and `String response = in.readLine()` to read a message from the server

            out.close();
            in.close();
            sslSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("I/O error in SSL connection setup: " + e);
        } 
    }
}
```

This is just a skeleton for a SSL socket connection in Java. It doesn't handle certificate validation, customized SSL context or SSL session parameters. 

Also, communication logic needs to be added as per requirements. User messages can be sent using the `PrintWriter` and responses from the server can be read using the `BufferedReader`. For security reasons, we should close all I/O streams and the socket after finishing the communication.

Please note: This is not sufficient for production code. In security-critical applications, a lot more measures should be implemented. For example, hostname verification, certificate revocation checks etc. 

Always consult with an expert or a security advisor when dealing with sensitive data transmission over networks to make sure the connection is secure enough.
