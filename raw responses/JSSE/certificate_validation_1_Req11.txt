Sure, I can provide you with a simple implementation of SSL certificate validation in Java. For this purpose, we'll be using Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) which is a set of packages that enable secure Internet communications. It provides a framework and an implementation for a Java version of the SSL and TLS protocols and includes functionality for data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication.

Below is a general idea of how to enable secure communication with a server.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.TrustManager;
import javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
            new X509TrustManager() {
                public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                    return new X509Certificate[0];
                }

                public void checkClientTrusted(
                        X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }

                public void checkServerTrusted(
                        X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
            }
        };

        // Install the all-trusting trust manager
        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        // Now you can access an https URL without having the certificate in the truststore
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://example.com/");
            HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            urlConnection.connect();
            //fetch and use data

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This script will tell the JSSE to trust all the certificates, whether they are in the trust store or not. Please remember this is just a sample code and in production, you should always validate certificates against your trust store.

Let me know if you need a more sophisticated example or a different use-case.
