Here's a simple implementation using Java's standard SSL infrastructure, specifically, the SSLSocketFactory, SSLSocket, and HTTPS_URL classes.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String hostname = "www.example.com"; // replace with your host
        int port = 443; // replace with your port

        SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory)SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket(hostname, port);

        // initiate the SSL handshake
        socket.startHandshake();

        // verify the server's certificate
        SSLSession session = socket.getSession();
        java.security.cert.Certificate[] servercerts = session.getPeerCertificates();

        // get the hostname of the server certificate 
        String serverCertHostName = ((X509Certificate)servercerts[0]).getSubjectX500Principal().getName();

        System.out.println("Host Name: " + serverCertHostName);
 
        // verify the hostname
        if(!hostname.equals(serverCertHostName)) {
             throw new SSLHandshakeException("Expected " + hostname + ", got " + serverCertHostName);
        }
    }
}
```
The above code does the following:

1. Establishes a standard SSL socket to the server with the specified hostname
2. Initiates the SSL handshake, during which the server's certificate (which includes the hostname) is retrieved
3. Retrieves the hostname from the certificate
4. Compares the expected hostname (given when the socket is created) with the one retrieved from the certificate. If there's a mismatch, it throws an exception.

**Please note:** This is a basic implementation which may not cover all the cases related to hostname verification in SSL/TLS communication, particularly those involving wildcards and subdomains. It is highly recommended to use specialized libraries or the SSL parameters offered by Java (from version 7 onwards) for more comprehensive hostname verification.
