The mentioned requirement can not be accomplished using only Java or Android APIs due to the security and sandboxing measures configured inside Android. 

Google Play Protect is primarily responsible for the security of the apps. However, you can implement SafetyNet API which provides a set of services and APIs that help protect your app against security threats, including device tampering, bad URLs, potentially harmful apps, and fake users.

Here is an example of how you can use the SafetyNet API for checking app integrity.

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnFailureListener;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;

public class Main {

    private void checkAppIntegrity() {
        String nonceData = "The data that you want to send to the server";

        SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest(nonceData.getBytes(), "<Your API Key>")
            .addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse>() {
                @Override
                public void onSuccess(SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response) {
                    // Indicates communication with the service was successful.
                    // Use response.getJwsResult() to get the result data.
                }
            })
            .addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {
                @Override
                public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) {
                    // An error occurred while communicating with the service.
                }
            });
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.checkAppIntegrity();
    }
}
```
This code snippet sends a stored set of data (nonce) to Google Play's safety servers. The server then checks to make sure that the application is legitimate, not tampered with, and responds with a simple yes/no message.

Please remember that the SafetyNet Attestation check does include a charge, and that using this in a real-world application should done with caution in mind due to the risk of false positives and negatives.

Also note: The code has been simplified, and doesn't apply best practices for clarity. Some better practices might be to process the attestation response in a secure server, and not to depend solely on the result of such checks for providing access to your app or its resources.
