Given the scope of this request, you would primarily need to rely on the FingerprintManager or BiometricPrompt API, depending on the Android version your application is targeting. This would only handle the part of fingerprint authentication and not the actual recognition and processing of the fingerprints.

The actual fingerprint image recognition process that happens in the hardware is not accessible for security reasons.

Here is a basic template of how you can integrate fingerprint authentication into your app:

```java
import android.Manifest;
import android.annotation.SuppressLint;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
import android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager;
import android.os.Build;
import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import androidx.core.app.ActivityCompat;
import android.widget.Toast;

@SuppressLint("NewApi")
public class Main extends AppCompatActivity {

    private FingerprintManager fingerprintManager;
    private KeyguardManager keyguardManager;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            return;
        }
        fingerprintManager = getSystemService(FingerprintManager.class);
        keyguardManager = getSystemService(KeyguardManager.class);

        if (!fingerprintManager.isHardwareDetected()) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "Your device doesn't support fingerprint authentication", 
                           Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        } else {
            if (!fingerprintManager.hasEnrolledFingerprints()) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "No fingerprint configured. Please register at least one fingerprint 
                                     in your device's settings", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            } else {
                if (!keyguardManager.isKeyguardSecure()) {
                    Toast.makeText(this, "Please enable lockscreen security in your device's settings", 
                                   Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                } else {
                    startAuthentication();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void startAuthentication(){
        // Call the FingerprintManager's authenticate method here.
        // This is where you will generally start another activity or maybe a service 
        // which will show a dialog for the user to touch their fingerprint sensor.
    }
}
```
In the `startAuthentication()` method, you would call the FingerprintManager's `authenticate()` method, handle the encryption keys and start either a service or an activity to prompt the users to touch their fingerprint sensors.

After starting FingerprintManager's authenticate() method, For every changes that occur during the authentication process(upon success or failure or error), a callback will be triggered and can be handled with FingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback.

This is a high-level overview on how you can implement the fingerprint authentication mechanism. Please note this is a simplified code and you might need to handle the use cases, exceptions and make the implementation to fulfill your own requirements. Also, make sure to follow the best practices for handling sensitive data and using  fingerprint authentication with strong encryption.
