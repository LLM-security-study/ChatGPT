Sure, following is a Java program using AES in CBC mode to decrypt data.

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try
        {
            // Your secret key, stored securely
            String secret = "mySuperSecretKey"; 

            // CipherText written in base64
            String encryptedText = "scDfJZT+89K2xABELYjP/Q==";

            // Initialization Vector, needed for CBC mode
            byte[] iv = new byte[16];

            // Using AES encryption with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding
            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
            SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(secret.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), "AES");

            // Decryption starts
            cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new IvParameterSpec(iv));
            byte[] decrypted = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encryptedText));

            System.out.println("Decrypted text: " + new String(decrypted));
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }  
    }
}
```
This simple program uses the AES algorithm in CBC mode to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted text. Usually, the key and initialization vector (IV) are not hardcoded into the program like this, you'll need to handle key management more carefully in a real-world project. Make sure "mySuperSecretKey" is a 16-character long key because AES requires a key of 16 bytes. 

Please make sure to replace the variable `encryptedText` with the text you want to decrypt. 

This program assumes the encrypted text is a Base64-encoded string. If your encrypted data is in another format, you may need to modify the line where it decodes the Base64 string.

Also, exception handling over here is basic with `e.printStackTrace()`, in a full-fledged application, you would want to have a proper exception handling mechanism.
