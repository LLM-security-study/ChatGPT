Right now, there isn't a direct API provided by Google Play that allows us to check whether an Android app binary has been modified. However, Google Play Protect is Google's built-in malware protection for Android which verifies the integrity of the apps installed. This happens in the background and users can also manually trigger the verification. 

You can encourage users to keep the Google Play Protect feature enabled which would automatically notify them in case of any suspicious activity detected with the app such as modifying the binary. Below is an example of usage of "SafetyNet Attestation API" to verify the integrity of a device. 

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnCompleteListener;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.Task;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        String nonceData = "3d2fce7cdf76"; // A random value generated by your app
        ByteString nonce = ByteString.copyFromUtf8(nonceData); 

        SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest(nonce.toByteArray(), "<Your_API_Key_Here>")
        .addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse> task) {
                if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                    SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response = task.getResult();
                    byte[] attestationResponse = response.getJwsResult().getBytes();
                    // Send these bytes to your server to verify on server side.
                } else {
                    // An error occurred while communicating with the SafetyNet API
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This Java program is a very simplistic implementation of the SafetyNet Attestation API. Here, we are starting an asynchronous request to the SafetyNet Attestation API which compares the given API key's settings and the device's status. It receives a JWT (JSON Web Token) detailing the result of the API's tests and comparisons. 

However, it's important to understand that this attestation is not a bulletproof guarantee against binary modification. An attacker can potentially bypass the test. As always with security, it is just one part of the overall strategy.
