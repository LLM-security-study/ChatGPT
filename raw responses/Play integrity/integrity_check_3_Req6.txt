Identifying the integrity of an Android device may require several checks such as:

- Checking for the presence of root
- Checking for the presence of certain APKs

This can be accomplished through the use of the SafetyNet Attestation API, which provides an integrity check mechanism for Android devices.

Now let's proceed to code:

```java
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNet;
import com.google.android.gms.safetynet.SafetyNetApi;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        SafetyNet.getClient(this).attest("SAMPLE_NONCE".getBytes(), "YOUR_API_KEY")
                .addOnSuccessListener(this,
                        new OnSuccessListener<SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse>() {
                            @Override
                            public void onSuccess(SafetyNetApi.AttestationResponse response) {
                                // Use response.getJwsResult() to get result of integrity check
                                String jwsResult = response.getJwsResult();
                                System.out.println("Integrity check result: " + jwsResult);
                                
                                //TODO: Add your code to parse the jwsResult and make decision based on that
                            }
                        });
    }
}
```

Please note:

- The above code snippet makes a call to the SafetyNet Attestation API. The call includes a nonce that must be generated using a secure random number generator. Here, "SAMPLE_NONCE" is just a placeholder.

- "YOUR_API_KEY" must be replaced with your actual API key.

- The `AttestationResponse` object's `getJwsResult()` method returns a JWS (JSON Web Signature) string that contains a cryptographic signature that you can use to validate the response.

- After attestation, a JWS (JSON Web Signature) message is returned from the API. This message should be sent securely to a backend server where its signature can be verified.
