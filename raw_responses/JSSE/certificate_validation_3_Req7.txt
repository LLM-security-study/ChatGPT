You can use `javax.net.ssl` API in Java to implement certificate validation. For this, we typically need a `javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager` which is responsible for managing the X509 certificates, which is a standard defining the format of public key certificates.

Here is a very basic example to handle certificate validation using TrustManager.

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");

        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {new X509TrustManager() {
            public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                return new X509Certificate[0];
            }
            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {}
            public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {}
        } };

        sslContext.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());

        URL url = new URL("https://your-url");
        HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();

        // dummy all trusting host verifier
        connection.setHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() {
            public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
                return true;
            }
        });
      
        // Code to use the connection goes here.
    }
}
```
Caution: This example disables many of the SSL security checks, making it useful for testing purposes, but unsuitable for production. You would need to customize the `X509TrustManager` and `HostnameVerifier` to suit your security requirements. This example also lacks error checking and exception handling for brevity.

To understand the use of this code better and enhance it accordingly, you could look into the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) Reference Guide and other resources.
